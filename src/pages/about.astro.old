        <p>Hi, I’m Wahiduz Zaman Alam, a software engineer with a strong focus on
        frontend development and product experience. Over the years, I’ve worked
        on building responsive, clean, and user-friendly web applications using
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.js, Next.js, and
        Astro.<br></p>
        <p>I’ve also taken on responsibilities beyond development
        including product management, shaping feature workflows, and improving
        user journeys. I enjoy transforming ideas into real, functional
        experiences and making sure the product is both effective and easy to
        use.<br></p>
        <p> Along the way, I’ve created GIFs, explainer videos, and visual
        content to demonstrate product workflows and simplify complex concepts
        for users and teams.<br></p>
        <p> I love building intuitive interfaces, optimizing
        performance, and continuously learning new tools and techniques to
        create better digital experiences.<br></p>
